Graduating in Computer Science at Federal University of Amazonas.

During college I had experience with projects related to machine learning and natural language processing. I was part of the Academic Center for Computer Science (CACICOM) for two years as the Sports Director and I volunteered as an instructor in the freshman level in Introduction to Calculus and Introduction to C programming language.

As a software developer, I work at one of the most traditionally and renowned companies in the city of Manaus: FPF Tech. I have the opportunity to work with excellent and very experienced people by my side. I worked on projects for companies in the region and multinational companies impacting thousands of people.

As a professional I love what I do and deeply admire the colleagues who work with me in the field. It always inspires me to know that I can create solutions that change people's lives directly with effort and creativity at any time. As a person I am very proud of Manaus, where I was born and live until today, and I love all the aspects that make it unique.
